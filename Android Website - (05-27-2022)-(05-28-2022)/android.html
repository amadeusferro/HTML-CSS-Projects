            <h1>Android Mascot History</h1>
        
            <p>You probably know that the <strong>Android</strong> operating system, maintained by <strong>Google</strong>, is one of the most used for mobile devices in the world. But maybe you don't know that your friendly mascot has a name and a very curious history. Well, follow this article to learn a lot about this little robot.</p>
        
            <h2>The first version</h2>
        
            <p>The first attempt at creating a mascot came in 2007 from a developer named <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/dan-morrill-shows-us-the-android-mascot-that-almost-was-20130103/" target="_blank">Dan Morrill</a>. He says that he opened <a href="https://inkscape.org/" target="_blank">Inkscape</a> (free software for vectorizing images) and created his own version of a robot. The goal was just to personify the system just for his team, there was no request from the company to create a mascot.</p>

            </picture>
        
            <p>This first bizarre version was even named in honor of its creator: "<strong>The Dandroids</strong>".</p>
        
            <h2>A new mascot appears</h2>
        
            <p>The idea of having a mascot matured, and the mission was passed on to a professional in the area. The russian illustrator <a href="https://www.irinablok.com/" target="_blank">Irina Blok</a>, also a <strong>Google</strong> employee, was given the mission to represent the little robot in a more pleasant way.</p>

                <source media="(max-width: 670px)" srcset="images/irina-blok-small.jpg">
                <img src="images/irina-blok.jpg" alt="Irina Blok" title="Irina Block">
            </picture>
        
            <p>Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with few strokes and in a flatter way. The drawing should also generate quick identification with the viewer. Then came the <strong>Bugdroid</strong>, the new mascot of <strong>Android</strong>.</p>
        
            <img src="images/bugdroid.png" class="small" alt="Bugdroid" title="Android logo">
        
            <p>The main inspiration for the features of the new <strong>Bugdroid</strong> came from those little dolls that illustrate bathroom doors to indicate the gender of each door. Legend has it that the artist was creating on her desk at <strong>Google</strong>'s office and looked towards the bathrooms and the identification was immediate: simple, clean and objective.</p>

                <p>Another curious thing about <strong>Android</strong> is that each version has always been named after a sweet, in alphabetical order from version 1.5 to 9.0.</p>
        
                <ul>
                    <li>1.5 - Cupcake</li>
                    <li>1.6 - Donut</li>
                    <li>3.0 - Ã‰clair</li>
                    <li>2.2 - Froyo</li>
                    <li>2.3 - Gingerbread</li>
                    <li>3.0 - Honeycomb</li>
                    <li>4.0 - Ice Cream Sandwich</li>
                    <li>4.1 - Jelly Bean</li>
                    <li>4.4 - KitKat</li>
                    <li>5.0 - Lollipop</li>
                    <li>6.0 - Marshmallow</li>
                    <li>7.0 - Nougat</li>
                    <li>8.0 - Oreo</li>
                    <li>9.0 - Pie</li>
                </ul>
        
                <p>Unfortunately, <strong>Android Q</strong> not exist, because <strong>Google</strong> decided to put an end to this fun practice and started using numbers, which gave rise to <strong>Android 10</strong>.</p>
        
                <p>Access the <a href="https://www.android.com/intl/en_uk/history/#/donut" target="_self">Android History Website</a> to learn about the sequence of the "sweetened" versions and what each one brought to the Android system.</p>
